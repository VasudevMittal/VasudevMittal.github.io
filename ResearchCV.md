**Research Projects**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Bayesian Approaches to Cosmic Dipole***\
*Supervisor: Prof. Geraint F. Lewis, The University of Sydney*\
*Duration: August 2023 - May 2024*\
*Visiting Research Student at The University of Sydney*\
**Abstract:** The project involves the study of the all-sky Catalogue and calculation of the Cosmic dipole using Bayesian techniques. It is expected that the results will give better insights into the dipole problem and its possible origin. The study is significant because it will bring together results from different catalogues and hence give a better insight into the problem.

***Inconsistency in Matter and Kinetic Dipole using SN-Ia***\
*Supervisor: Prof. Dominik Schwarz, Bielefeld University*\
*Duration: May 2023 - July 2023*\
*DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) WISE 2023 Fellowship*\
**Abstract:** The project involved the study of the Pantheon+SH0ES Catalogue and calculation of the Cosmic dipole using MCMC techniques. The improvements made in Pantheon+ were studied, and some adjustments were made in the covariance matrix to account for local bulk flow. An anomalous matter dipole that is different from the kinetic dipole was found, and its evolution with z was studied.

***Investigating the Anisotropy of the Universe***\
*Supervisors: Prof. Subir Sarkar, University of Oxford, and Dr. Mohamed Rameez, TIFR*\
*Duration: April 2022 - April 2023*\
*INSPIRE-SHE Summer Fellowship*\
**Abstract:** The project involved the study of different aspects of cosmic dipole anisotropy. Different probable theoretical explanations involving modified gravity, isocurvature perturbations and bianchi models were studied in depth. Furthermore, inherent bias of estimators used for calculating the dipole from all-sky surveys was characterized.

***Scalar Fields Models of Dark Energy***\
*Supervisor: Dr. Arindam Chatterjee, Shiv Nadar University*\
*Duration: July 2021 - August 2021*\
*Science Academies Summer Research Fellowship*\
**Abstract:** The project involved a study of some of the major scalar field models of Dark Energy. Thawing and Tracker models of Dark Energy were studied, and their implications on the evolution history of the universe was investigated in depth. The observational implications of these models was also studied in some depth.

***Dark Energy in Generalized Trace Dynamics (GTD)***\
*Supervisor: Prof. TP Singh, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)*\
*Duration: February 2021 - June 2021*\
**Abstract:** The project involved the derivation of the EoS of Dark Energy in GTD. Probable Scalar fields that can drive the cosmic expansion were investigated. It was shown that one of the Scalar field gave a corrective term to the cosmological constant, hence resulting in evolution of Dark Energy EoS in time. This was the first time such an exercise was attempted in the GTD framework.

***Studying Gravitational Wave Sources by Python Simulations***\
*Supervisor: Prof. Jasjeet Singh Bagla, IISER Mohali*\
*Duration: May 2020 - July 2020*\
**Abstract:** This project involved the study of black holes with the help of gravitational waves. A 2-body system of black holes with one of undetermined parameters and another with parameters of Sgr-A* were simulated in python, and the waves produced from their merger were fitted to the available GW data to determine the unknown parameters of the companion.
