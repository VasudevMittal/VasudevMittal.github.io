### Bayesian Approaches to the Cosmic Dipole (Master's thesis)

**Abstract:** The Cosmological Principle asserts that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous on large scales and attributes the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) thermal dipole to our departure from the local Hubble flow. If this attribution is correct, then surveys of cosmological sources should show a similar dipole in their sky distribution. However, recent studies have found a disagreement between the kinematic expectations and the observed clustering dipole, with claims reaching well over 5σ! This thesis aims to study this tension between the kinematic dipole and the matter dipoles.

### [The Cosmic Dipole in the Quaia Sample of Quasars: A Bayesian Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad3706)
**Authors:** *Mittal, Vasudev*; Oyada Oliver; Lewis, Geraint F. \
**Journal:** Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \
Volume 527, Issue 3, January 2024, Pages 8497–8510, ISSN: 1365-2966 \
**Abstract:** We present a Bayesian analysis of the Quaia sample of 1.3 million quasars as a test of the cosmological principle. This principle postulates that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, forming the basis of prevailing cosmological models. However, recent analyses of quasar samples have found a matter dipole inconsistent with the inferred kinematic dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), representing a tension with the expectations of the cosmological principle. Here, we explore various hypotheses for the distribution of quasars in Quaia, finding that the sample is influenced by selection effects with significant contamination near the Galactic Plane. After excising these regions, we find significant evidence that the Quaia quasar dipole is consistent with the CMB dipole, both in terms of the expected amplitude and direction. This result is in conflict with recent analyses, lending support to the cosmological principle and the interpretation that the observed dipole is due to our local departure from the Hubble flow.

### [Low scientific research output in India: A critical analysis of NEP 2020 regarding scientific research](https://www.researchjournal.in/download/rjosls/17.pdf)
**Authors:** *Mittal, Vasudev* \

Volume 32, Year-16, June 2020, Pages 17-21, ISSN: 0973-3914 \
**Abstract:** The National Education Policy 2020 aim to bring the level of Academic Research in Science up to the level of excellence. The policy is largely based on a series of changes which have the potential to do that if they are seriously executed. But despite that some of the flaws in the academic system are far to great to be removed by this policy. The author aims to take the reader on a ride in which they would together look at some of the flaws of the academia, and how they can be removed. The paper is largely divided into 3 main parts- first part discuss the problem, the second part discuss what National Education Policy 2020 is doing and the third part deals with what else should be done. After reading this paper the readers will have a broad idea of what the National Education Policy, 2020 is doing to help the academia. For the sake of clarity, the steps taken in policy written in a simplified manner so that it becomes comprehensible for someone who is not an expert in the field.
