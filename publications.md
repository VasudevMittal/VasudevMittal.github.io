| Abstract | We examine the sky distribution of radio galaxies in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). Analyses of these samples have reported tension between their inferred dipoles and the kinematic dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This represents a challenge to the traditional assumption that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales: the cosmological principle. We find that NVSS and RACS contain local radio sources which give a non-negligible contribution to the overall dipole signal. These need to be adequately accounted for since the aim is to probe the composition of the Universe at large scales. By appropriately considering these sources, the inferred dipole amplitude in either sample is reduced. Nonetheless, we find support for a dipole aligning with that of the CMB but larger in amplitude, especially in the joint analysis. However, the 'clustering dipole' - the contribution of local sources to the net inferred dipole - appears to align with the direction of the CMB dipole, and its magnitude increases as deeper nearby sources are considered up to a comoving distance of ≈130 Mpc (h=0.7). The significance of this observation in the context of the cosmological principle is unclear and prompts further inquiry.|

| Abstract | The Cosmological Principle asserts that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous on large scales and attributes the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) thermal dipole to our departure from the local Hubble flow. If this attribution is correct, then surveys of cosmological sources should show a similar dipole in their sky distribution. However, recent studies have found a disagreement between the kinematic expectations and the observed clustering dipole, with claims reaching well over 5σ! This thesis aims to study this tension between the kinematic dipole and the matter dipoles.|

| Abstract | We present a Bayesian analysis of the Quaia sample of 1.3 million quasars as a test of the cosmological principle. This principle postulates that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, forming the basis of prevailing cosmological models. However, recent analyses of quasar samples have found a matter dipole inconsistent with the inferred kinematic dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), representing a tension with the expectations of the cosmological principle. Here, we explore various hypotheses for the distribution of quasars in Quaia, finding that the sample is influenced by selection effects with significant contamination near the Galactic Plane. After excising these regions, we find significant evidence that the Quaia quasar dipole is consistent with the CMB dipole, both in terms of the expected amplitude and direction. This result is in conflict with recent analyses, lending support to the cosmological principle and the interpretation that the observed dipole is due to our local departure from the Hubble flow.|

| Abstract | The National Education Policy 2020 aim to bring the level of Academic Research in Science up to the level of excellence. The policy is largely based on a series of changes which have the potential to do that if they are seriously executed. But despite that some of the flaws in the academic system are far to great to be removed by this policy. The author aims to take the reader on a ride in which they would together look at some of the flaws of the academia, and how they can be removed. The paper is largely divided into 3 main parts- first part discuss the problem, the second part discuss what National Education Policy 2020 is doing and the third part deals with what else should be done. After reading this paper the readers will have a broad idea of what the National Education Policy, 2020 is doing to help the academia. For the sake of clarity, the steps taken in policy written in a simplified manner so that it becomes comprehensible for someone who is not an expert in the field.|
